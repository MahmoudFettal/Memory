# Memory
Welcome to memory made with JavaFX, this report provides the source code of the project, further improvements might be made. In the meantime there are 16 cards available but only 8 are shown in the demo, you can change that by changing the size of the board in the main file but the size of the cards doesn't scale when the size of the board exceeds the size of the screen (this issue is on the project's to-do list)
